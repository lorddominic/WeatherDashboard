This assignment requires us master the process of using ajax call to get different informations from a certain resource. The hard part of the assignment was taking care of the three ajax call. Getting data from a ajax call, then use the data as arguments to another ajax call. This assignment is surely challenging. It's a great practice of using ajax to connect to multiple resources.
